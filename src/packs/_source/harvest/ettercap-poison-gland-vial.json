      "value": "An ettercaps poison gland may be harvested in order to acquire the creatures poison. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this gland. On a successful check, the character harvests the creature's poison gland that must be refined before producing 1 dose of Ettercap Poison (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the poison gland. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the gland is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 1 hour and 50gp worth of material to create Ettercap Poison (DC 12 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Ettercap Poison (Injury): A creature can spend an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until it successfully affects a target. A creature hit with a weapon coated with this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This poison usually sells for 100gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
