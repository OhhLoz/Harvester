      "value": "Hoard scarabs produce a sticky, glittering metallic dust from their wings. The sticky glitter is difficult to collect, but a swarm of hoard scarabs may have enough dust to fill a pouch. The dust has arcane properties and is valued by alchemists, often aiding in the creation of potions and elixirs involving light and tracking.Use: A pouch of this dust may be thrown up to 20 feet and the pouch explodes upon impact. Any creature within 10 feet of impact must roll a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in blue light for 10 minutes. While outlined in this way, a creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from being invisible.",
