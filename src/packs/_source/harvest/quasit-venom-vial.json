      "value": "Quasit venom coats a Quasit's claws and teeth. The translucent fluid has a cloudy yellow tint. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests a mild form of the venom that must be refined before producing 1 dose of Quasit Poison (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any venom. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's venom. Refining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend an 6 hours and 100gp worth of material to create Quasit Poison (DC 15 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Quasit Poison (Injury): A creature can use an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until the poison successfully affects a target. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. This poison usually sells for 200gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
