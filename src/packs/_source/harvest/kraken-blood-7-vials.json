      "value": "A kraken's blood is dark blue with a low viscosity, and smells like the shore during low tide. The legendary creature's blood radiates with arcane energy, especially since they are believed to have once been fierce warriors of the gods, and even have their own cults and followers. Alchemists and magic users all clamor for a little bit of this creature's blood.",
