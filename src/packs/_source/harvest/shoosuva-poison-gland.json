      "value": "A shoosuva's tail has a large poisonous stinger on the end. A skilled harvester can attempt to dissect the stinger and remove the poison gland. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this gland. On a successful check, the character harvests the creature's poison gland that must be refined before producing 1 dose of Yeenoghu's Sting (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the poison gland. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's sting. Refining the Poison: Once the gland is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 6 hours and 100gp worth of material to create Yeenoghu's Sting (DC 16 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Yeenoghu's Sting (Injury): A creature can use an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until the poison successfully affects a target. Yeenoghu's Sting is slightly stronger than Carrion Crawler Mucus. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned, the target is also paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on success. This poison usually sells for 250gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
