      "value": "The pineal gland is believed to be the heart of a creature's psionic power. A braxat's pineal gland is a pea-shaped mound of soft, maroon flesh, about the size of a walnut. If the pineal gland is dried out and treated (using an alchemist's set), it will not expire for over a month. Uses: As a reaction, a creature can crush the Braxat's pineal gland, which will release a burst of psionic energy, allowing the creature to add their Intelligence modifier to their AC until the end of their next turn.",
