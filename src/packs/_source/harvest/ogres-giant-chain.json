      "value": "A chain ogre carried an enormous iron chain. The chain is over 15 feet long and weighs over 150 lbs. Each link is 6 inches thick, 1 foot long, and 8 inches wide. The chain is poorly forged, but shipbuilders, architects and smiths may find it useful. If the harvesting check is failed, the quality is extremely poor or the chain was shattered to pieces during the fight.",
