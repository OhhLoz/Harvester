      "value": "A gorgon has the ability to exhale a petrifying gas. This gas builds up and is stored in a sac at the base of the creatures neck. If the sac is removed too quickly, or incorrectly, it may burst. On a successful harvesting check, the character harvests the gas sac. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the gas sac. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the petrifying vapor. Use: As an action you may throw the sac up to 20 feet, where it explodes. Each creature in a 10-foot radius must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effects ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.",
