Use: You may spend an action to open this flask and release the banshee wail kept within. All creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a creature takes 3d6 psychic damage. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead.",
