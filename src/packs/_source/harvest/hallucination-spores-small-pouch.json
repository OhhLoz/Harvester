      "value": "Myconid sovereigns have the ability to emit a spray of soft purple spores, that appear as a translucent purple mist. These spores can cause hallucinations among non-myconids. This item is sought after by shady alchemists and illicit drug dealers. Use: A creature can use an action to make a ranged attack and throw the pouch of hallucination spores at a target within 10 feet that it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is incapacitated while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.",
