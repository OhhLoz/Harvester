      "value": "This item can only be harvested if the myconid hasn't used all of its Pacifying Spores abilities (3/day). These light pink spores have a sweet smell and a calming effect. Alchemists find these spores useful in creating concoctions. Some medicinal experts and healers can create painkiller and sedatives using the spores. Use: A creature can use an action to make a ranged attack to throw the pouch of pacifying spores at a target within 10 feet that it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. This effect ends if the target is attacked. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.",
