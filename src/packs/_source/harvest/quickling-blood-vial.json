      "value": "Quickling blood flows quickly, having an extremely low viscosity. It is a red substance, with tiny swirling motes that appear to swim around inside the substance. It is difficult to fill a vial with so much blood from such a small creature. The blood is valued by alchemists. Use: A creature may spend an action to drink a vial of this blood. The creature will gain an extra reaction per round (if the creature normally has 1 action per round, they now have 2). This benefit lasts for 10 minutes.",
