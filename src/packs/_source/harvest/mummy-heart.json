      "value": "When the body of a mummy is prepared, the body is cut open and all of the organs are removed, each being preserved in a ceremonial urn. These urns are often located somewhere within the mummy's lair (DMs discretion on the urns location). While the heart is desiccated and somewhat preserved, the harvesting DC check determines if the heart doesn't get damaged or crumble to dust when it is removed from the urn. The heart is useful to necromancers, artificers and other spellcasters.",
