      "value": "Only female sahuagin are deemed worthy of channeling the shark god Sekolah's power. It may be possible that a sahuagin priestess has various opaque, spongy egg sacs stuck to her back. The eggs are always unfertilized, as fertilized eggs are removed and taken to a hatchery. The eggs are a delicacy in some coastal cities, but are also used in potions and fertility rituals.",
