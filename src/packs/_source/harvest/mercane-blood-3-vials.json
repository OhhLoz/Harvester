      "value": "Mercanes have white, translucent blood, swirling with glowing motes. The blood has many unique properties valued by alchemists. However, since killing a mercane is frowned upon by most merchants, many wont buy or sell the item. Reputable merchants know that mercane's specialize in trading magic items and artifacts, and they have a telepathic link to other mercanes, immediately warning of dangerous individuals.",
