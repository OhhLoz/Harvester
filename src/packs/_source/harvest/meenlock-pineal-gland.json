      "value": "At the base of a meenlock's brain is a small blue gland that controls the creature's telepathic abilities. These abilities allow meenlocks to psychically join together and attack another creature, forcing it to painfully transform into a meenlock itself. This gland is highly valued by spellcasters and those that study psionic abilities. Alchemist want an enzyme that the gland secretes.",
