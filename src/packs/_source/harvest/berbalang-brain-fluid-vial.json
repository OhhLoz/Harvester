      "value": "The brain fluid of a berbalang must be carefully collected from a berbalang's brain before it spoils from the toxins and bacteria of its dead body. The fluid has alchemical uses, but is highly valued by divination wizards and clerics. Use: When used as a material component, the brain fluid will double the duration of the following spells: speak with dead, borrowed knowledge or tongues. The brain fluid quickly dries after the spell is cast, and can not be reused.",
