      "value": "A roper has a thick, stone shell that allows it to hide among stalactites and stalagmites. The shell is rock hard, made primarily of calcium carbonate, which is secreted by the creatures skin. The shell can be used to create armor and shields. It can also be ground into its base components, which are composed of various minerals useful to healers and alchemists.",
