      "value": "White matter is found in the deeper tissue of the brain. Ripples of psionic energy flow through the tissue like electricity. Harvesting the tissue can be difficult, as it takes a great deal of dexterity and medical knowledge. Failing the DC check by 5 or more results in a backlash of psionic energy, sending out a wave of 4d6 psionic damage to every conscious creature in a 15-foot radius. The tissue is a psionic sponge, valued by spellcasters.",
