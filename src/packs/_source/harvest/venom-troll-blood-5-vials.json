      "value": "The blood of a venom troll contains a vile poison. The blood is a watery green fluid. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests enough venom for a single vial. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 12 hour and 100gp worth of material to create Troll Venom (DC 12 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Troll Venom (Injury): A creature can use a vial of this poison to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This poison usually sells for 200gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
