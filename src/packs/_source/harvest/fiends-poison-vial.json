      "value": "Erinyes often coat their weapons in a vile poison, which they carry in a small glass vial. Fiend's Poison: A creature can coat up to 3 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon. Applying the poison takes an action. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until a creature is exposed to the poison. Any creature successfully hit must succeed a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 3d8 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 hour. This poison usually sells for 250gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
