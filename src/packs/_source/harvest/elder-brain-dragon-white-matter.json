      "value": "White matter is found in the deep tissue of the enormous brain that sits on the back of the elder brain dragon. Ripples of psionic energy flow through the tissue like electricity. Harvesting the tissue can be difficult, as it takes a great deal of dexterity and medical knowledge. Failing the DC check by 5 or more results in a backlash of psionic energy, sending out a wave of 4d6 psionic damage to every conscious creature in a 15-foot radius. The tissue is a psionic sponge, valued by spellcasters.",
