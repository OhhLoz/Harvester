      "value": "Requires an enchanted vial. If one is quick, and has an enchanted vial, it is possible to capture the final breath of a faerie dragon. The breath contains a highly euphoric gas that is valued by alchemists and artificers. Use: Using an action, you can throw the vial at a target within 20 ft. On a successful hit, the vial shatters and the gas is released. The target must succeed a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target is affected by a sense of euphoria. It can't take an action, bonus action or reaction, and must use its movement to move in a random direction. At the end of each of its turn, it can attempt the save again. A successful roll ends the effect.",
