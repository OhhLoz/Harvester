      "value": "These tentacles, used by the death kiss to drain blood, are often purchased by scholars, magic users and medical researchers. An expert craftsman can stretch the tentacles and carefully comb them into long, thin fibers. These fibers are then soaked and treated with oils, making them useful filaments for creating ropes and whips.",
