      "value": "When a eidolon disperses, a trace amount of its spiritual essence is briefly left behind. It may be possible to collect this essence using a gem worth at least 100gp. A ritual can capture the essence into the gem, creating a spirit shard. The gem contains a small amount of arcane energy that spellcasters (especially necromancers) may be able to use and study. In addition, using the gem, a magic user with specific training may be able to pull information about the vault or temple the eidolon was guarding.",
