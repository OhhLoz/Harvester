      "value": "The giant wasp has a long stinger in its abdomen that contains a potent poison. A skilled harvester can attempt to remove the stinger intact. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this stinger. On a successful check, the character harvests the creature's stinger that must be refined before producing 1 dose of Stinger Poison (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the stinger. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the stinger is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 12 hours and 100gp worth of material to create Stinger Poison (DC 14 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Stinger Poison (Injury): Stinger Poison is similar to Serpent Venom (DMG p258). The poison can coat up to 3 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 1 minute. Applying the poison takes 1 action. Any creature successfully hit must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. This poison usually sells for 200gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
