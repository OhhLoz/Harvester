      "value": "Being possessed by a goblin trickster deity causes a nilbog's mouth to develop into a wide, toothy smile full of jagged, yellow teeth. As the jaw has been touched by a deity, albeit a minor one, it retains a trace amount of celestial power. The jaw of the creature is difficult to remove intact, and quite a messy affair, but is prized in the arcane community.",
