      "value": "When a mimic dies, it slowly melts into its original form, an amorphous gray blob. It is difficult to harvest even a strip of flesh from the creature, as it is like cutting through water. A mimic's natural skin is not good for making leather, but it is valued by transmutation spellcasters and those that study polymorphing.",
