      "value": "The stomach acid of a xorn is highly corrosive, allowing the creature to digest precious gems and hard metals. The acid is useful to many craftsmen and alchemists. Failing the harvesting check by 5 or more results in the harvester getting burned by the acid, taking 7 (2d6) acid damage. Use: A xorn's stomach acid is the equivalent of a vial of acid (PHB). As an action, a creature can splash the contents of this vial onto a target within 5 feet or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, the creature makes a ranged attack against a target or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.",
