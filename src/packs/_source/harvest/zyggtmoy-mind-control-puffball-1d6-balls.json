      "value": "Zuggtmoy's Mind Control Puffballs are small, puffy green balls that contain a collection of spores. These spores are prized by horticulturists and mycologists. Use: Using an action, you can throw one of these puffballs at a creature you can see within 30 feet. If the target is hit, the small ball explodes into a cloud of spores, and the target must make a DC 17 saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is under the effects of the charmed condition.",
