      "value": "The greenish-black slime of Jubilex is a vial concoction of nauseating thick fluid. The slime has various alchemical properties, but can also be used to create a deadly poison. Proficiency with the poisoner kit can be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the poison is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 1 day and 250gp worth of material to create Jubilex Poison (DC 15 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Jubilex Poison (Injury): A creature can use an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until the poison successfully affects a target. A creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 12 (4d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This poison can sell for 500gp.",
