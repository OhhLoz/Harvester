      "value": "The fetid stench of a dretch can be bottled and saved. If the character fails the harvesting by 5 or more, a potent form of the gas is released in a 10ft radius. Any creature in the area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or immediately take 1d8 poison damage. The damage continues every round until the creature leaves in the area. The gas lasts for 1 minute or until a Strong Wind disperses it. Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a point within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Any creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.",
