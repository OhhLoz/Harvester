      "value": "A cosmic horror has the ability to expel a poisonous foul gas. This gas builds up and is stored in a sac somewhere in the creature's torso. If the sac is removed too quickly, or incorrectly, it may burst. On a successful harvesting check, the character harvests the gas sac. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the gas sac. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character must make a DC 21 Constitution save or take 14 (4d6) poison damage. Use: As an action you may throw the sac up to 20 feet, where it explodes. Each creature in a 10-foot radius must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage.",
