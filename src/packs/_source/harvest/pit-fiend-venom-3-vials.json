      "value": "Hutijin's venom is a noxious, vile poison, found mixed in the pit fiends saliva.Proficiency with the poisoner kit can be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests enough vemon for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any venom. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison.Refining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 4 days and 500gp worth of material and supplies to create Pit Fiend venom (DC 20 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check).Pit Fiend Poison (Injury): A creature can use an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until the poison successfully affects a target. A creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This poison usually sells for 1100gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
