      "value": "Orogs are gifted by Luthic with strength and cunning. Their large size makes their heart considerably larger than other orcs, pumping harder and faster. The heart radiates a dark energy that can be harnessed. Use: As an action a creature may consume the heart. For the next minute, the creature deals an extra 1d8 damage when it hits with a melee attack. This ability does not work for elves and half-elves.",
