      "value": "A neothelid has long, light purple tentacles that end in sharp serrated edges. Normally covered in a corrosive digestive enzyme, the tentacles are tough, durable and resistant to caustic substances. An expert craftsman can stretch the tentacles and carefully comb them into long, thin fibers. These fibers are then soaked and treated with oils, making them useful filaments for creating ropes and whips.",
