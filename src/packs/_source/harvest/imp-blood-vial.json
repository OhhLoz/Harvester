      "value": "Imp blood is a red liquid with low viscosity. The blood can be used by spellcasters to enhance their familiars. Use: When casting the find familiar spell, you may use a vial of imp blood instead of the usual material component of the spell. If you do, your summoned familiar gains the magic resistance trait described in the imp familiar's statblock (advantage on saving throws against spells and magic effects). Your familiar also shares this trait with you so long as you are within 10 feet of it. Both of these effects last for 1 hour, or until your familiar is killed or is dismissed.",
