      "value": "If on the Material Plane, all that remains of this creature is the corpse that it possessed. However, if on the Abyss, one must first dissect the corpse to find the jellyfish-like form of the dybbuk. Once the dybbuk's semi-translucent membrane is pierced, a small amount of fluid can be extracted. This fluid has many alchemical properties, and is often studied by anyone researching necromancy and those that practice it.",
