      "value": "The giant centipede has a poisonous bite. A skilled harvester can extract a vial of the thick yellow venom. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests enough venom for a single vial. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any venom. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend an 3 hours and 60gp worth of material to create Scorpion Poison (DC 10 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Centipede Poison (Contact): Upon contact with this poison, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 4 (1d8) poison damage (NOT the poison condition). If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but paralyzed for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points. This poison usually sells for 120gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
