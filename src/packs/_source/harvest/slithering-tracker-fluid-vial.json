      "value": "When a slithering tracker is defeated, it falls into a puddle of clear liquid, with a reddish tint (even redder if it has killed recently). The fluid has a low viscosity and spreads out fast, flowing in crevasses and small holes, and and can be difficult to collect. The fluid has many alchemical properties. It is also valued by spellcasters and clerics of vengeful deities.",
