      "value": "A wyvern has a long tail with a poisonous stinger on the end. The poison is difficult to remove, and the poison is extremely potent. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this stinger. On a successful check, the character harvests the creature's stinger that must be refined before producing 1 dose of Stinger Poison (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the stinger. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the stinger is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 6 days and 600gp worth of material to create Wyvern Poison (DC 14 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Wyvern Poison (Injury): A vial of Wyvern Poison (DMG p258) can coat up to 3 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 1 minute. Applying the poison takes 1 action. Any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This poison usually sells for 1200gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
