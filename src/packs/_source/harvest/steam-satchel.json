      "value": "A dragon turtle's steam satchel is a bundle of three different glands, each of which secrete a variety of chemicals that react to create a boiling spray of steam. Healers and alchemists may be able to use the satchel's heating abilities. Artificers are always looking for items that can fuel their devices. Use: As an action, a creature may squeeze the steam satchel to release a 30-foot cone of scalding steam. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once used, the satchel is empty and cannot be used again.",
