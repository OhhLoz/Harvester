      "value": "The clear yellow venom of a neogi is used weaken and subjugate potential slaves. Proficiency with the poisoner kit can be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests enough venom for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any venom. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 1 day and 250gp worth of material to create Neogi Poison (DC 15 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Neogi Poison (Injury): A creature can use an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until the poison successfully affects a target. A creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 12 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This poison usually sells for 500gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
