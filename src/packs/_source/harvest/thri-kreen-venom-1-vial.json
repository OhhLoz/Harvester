      "value": "A thri-kreens's mandibles contain a simple venom that is capable of paralyzing its victims. The venom is a clear fluid with a yellow tint. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests 1 vial of venom that must be refined before producing 1 dose of Thri-kreen Poison (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any venom. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 12 hours and 100gp worth of material to create Thri-kreen Poison (DC 12 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Thri-kreen Poison (Injury): A creature can spend an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until it successfully affects a target. A creature hit with a weapon coated with this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This poison usually sells for 200gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
