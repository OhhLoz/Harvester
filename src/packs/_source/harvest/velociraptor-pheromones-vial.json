      "value": "The velociraptor uses its pheromones to communicate with the rest of their pack. Other beasts have a strong reaction to these pheromones. Druids, healers and alchemists may find the pheromones useful. Use: While you have this vial of pheromones open, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made to convince an animal that is friendly to you, and within 5 feet, to attack another creature. Beasts that are not friendly to you, and within 30 feet, will move attack you on their turn. The vials effect stops working after 3 uses.",
