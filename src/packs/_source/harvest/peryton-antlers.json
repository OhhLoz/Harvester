      "value": "A peryton has a set of large branching bone-like protrusions on the top of its head, similar to a buck. The antlers are covered in a thin layer of skin with a soft fur, that feels like velvet. The antlers are strong as steel, and can be used by craftsmen and weaponsmiths to create various items. They are also a prized trophy for hunters.",
