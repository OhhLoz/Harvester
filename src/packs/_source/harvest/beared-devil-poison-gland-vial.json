      "value": "Within the bearded devil's chin is a small, purple veiny bulb, which allows the devil to secrete a venom that coats it's oily beard. A skilled harvester can attempt to remove the gland. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this gland. On a successful check, the character harvests the creature's poison gland that must be refined before producing 1 dose of Bearded Devil Oil (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the poison gland. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the gland is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 12 hours and 100gp worth of material to create Bearded Devil Oil (DC 14 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Bearded Devil Oil (Injury): The poison can be used to coat up to 3 pieces of ammunition or one slashing/piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 action. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This poison usually sells for 150gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
