      "value": "Dragon meat is a delicacy and is considered one of the finest meats you can eat. The meat spoils fast, but gourmet chefs will pay dearly for the meat. Dragon Jerky: If the meat is dried and smoked, a young dragon can yield about 2d6 days worth of dragon jerky. Dragon jerky is extremely filling, and a days worth weighs only a quarter of a regular ration (0.5 lbs.). It costs 2gp per ration.",
