      "value": "A neothelid has two glands that secrete a collection of chemicals into the creature's throat. When these chemicals combine, and the neothelid exhales, a spray of acid shoots forth. If the harvesting DC check fails by 5 or more, the glandular sac ruptures, causing 4d6 acid damage to every creature within a 10-foot radius. These glands are valued by alchemist, artificers and anyone that studies illithids. Use: As an action, a creature may throw this sac at a point it can see within 20 feet, bursting on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",
