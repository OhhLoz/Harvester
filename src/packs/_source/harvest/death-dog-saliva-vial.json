      "value": "Death dog saliva is a nasty diseased substance, and care must be taken when harvesting. If the character fails the harvesting check by 5 or more, the character is affected by the saliva (see below). Alchemists and healers may find the saliva worth studying. If affected by the death dog's saliva, the target succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure.",
