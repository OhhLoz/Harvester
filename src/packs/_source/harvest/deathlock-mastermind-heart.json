      "value": "The dark, necrotic heart of a deathlock mastermind is tied to the warlock's patron. Use: At the DM's Discretion, a spellcaster may be able to perform a 10 minute ritual, using the heart, to determine who or what the patron of the deathlock mastermind was. The spellcaster will know the name of the patron (as the deathlock knew it) and have a visual image of the creature. If the patron is on the same plane, then the spellcaster will know which direction the patron is (but not know how far). This direction sense fades within an hour.",
