      "value": "A yochlol's yellowish ooze is a vile, poisonous substance. The ooze can be harvested and turned into Yochlol Poison. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this ooze. On a successful check, the character harvests the creature's ooze that must be refined before producing 1 dose of Yochlol Poison (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the ooze. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the ooze's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the ooze is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend an 2 days and 400gp worth of material to create Yochlol Poison (DC 17 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Yochlol Poison: A creature successfully hit with Yochlol Poison must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 6d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying, or until a target is successfully hit. This poison usually sells for 1000gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
