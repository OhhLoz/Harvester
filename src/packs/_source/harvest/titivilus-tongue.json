      "value": "Titivilus has a red, spongy tongue. It is rumored, falsely, that the tongue was made of silver because of Titivilus' persuasive ways. Despite his small stature, the archdevil was able to maneuver himself into a strong position in Hell. The tongue can be used to craft a powerful neck collar, allowing its wearing to charm and twist words.",
