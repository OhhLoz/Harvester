      "value": "A skilled harvester can extract the venom from poisonous snakes. The poison is a clear fluid with a yellow tint. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests enough venom for a single vial. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any venom. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend an 3 hours and 50gp worth of material to create Scorpion Poison (DC 10 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Snake Poison (Poison, Basic see PHB p153) (Injury): A creature can spend an action using a vial of this poison to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. This poison usually sells for 100gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
