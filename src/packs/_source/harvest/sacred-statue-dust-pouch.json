      "value": "When a sacred statue is destroyed, it crumbles to pieces. Many of the stones that made the statue shatter when hitting the ground, breaking apart, leaving behind magical rock dust. The dust is prized by sculptors and golem creators. The dust can be made into a paste that seals cracks in statues and masonry, and looks as if no damage occurred.",
