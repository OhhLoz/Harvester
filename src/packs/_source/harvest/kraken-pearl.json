      "value": "A kraken is a gargantuan devourer, swallowing tons of objects whole throughout the millennia. Some of the more valuable (and even magical) objects get caught in the creature's digestive tract, and are covered in a thick mucus that quickly hardens. Over time, the object is coated again and again, forming a glistening and hardened pearl. A fully-formed kraken's pearl can range from 2-3 feet in diameter. The beautiful sphere is prized by collectors, but also an object of great power (especially if the pearl is extremely old).",
