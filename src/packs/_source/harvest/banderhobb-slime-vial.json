      "value": "A moderate amount of slime can be extracted from a Banderhobb's corpse. Use: Using an action, the vial can be poured onto a Medium sized reptile (frog, lizard, snake, toad) or smaller. That creature immediately grows into the giant version of itself (see Monster Manual) for 1 hour. It returns to its normal size at the end of the hour, or if it drops to 0 hit points. While under the effect of this item, the creature becomes violent and attempts to attack the nearest creature it can see whenever possible.",
