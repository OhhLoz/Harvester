      "value": "Every hezrou gives off a fetid stench as a result of a stink gland near the back of its neck. The gland can be harvested and the malicious odor can be weaponized. If the harvesting fails by 5 or more, the gland bursts and everyone within 10ft is exposed to a potent form of the hezrou's stench. They must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for the next hour. Use: As an action you may throw this item at a point within 20 feet, causing it to explode on impact. Any creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.",
