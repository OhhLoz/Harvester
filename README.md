## Integration with the module [Better Rolltables](https://github.com/p4535992/foundryvtt-better-rolltables/tree/master) -  from p4535992

In the BRT Harvest Rolltable sheet, the "Source Reference" field is the one used by this module to connect the monster to the rolltable! So **"Source Reference" === "Name of The Monster"** , and REMEMBER YOU MUST PUT THE NEW ROLLTABLE IN THE BRT COMPENDIUM "better-rolltables.brt-harvest-harvester" or in the Rolltable directory of the world itself (for now).
