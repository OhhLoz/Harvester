The acid is useful to many craftsmen and alchemists. Failing the harvesting check by 5 or more results in the harvester getting burned by the acid, taking 7 (2d6) acid damage. Use: A giant toad's stomach acid is the equivalent of a vial of acid (PHB). As an action, a creature can splash the contents of this vial onto a target within 5 feet or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, the creature makes a ranged attack against a target or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.","chat":"15","unidentified":"Nature"},"source":"Giant Toad","quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":{"value":1,"denomination":"gp"},"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true},"folder":null,"ownership":{"default":0,"UDIYq77k2aTlndBT":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1687828492272,"modifiedTime":1687828492272,"lastModifiedBy":"UDIYq77k2aTlndBT"},"_id":"sv7os1kMBLgE5Lp5"}
