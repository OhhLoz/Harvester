On a successful check, the character harvests the creature's stinger that must be refined before producing 1 dose of Stinger Poison (see below). On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the stinger. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the stinger is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 6 days and 600gp worth of material to create Wyvern Poison (DC 14 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Wyvern Poison (Injury): A vial of Wyvern Poison (DMG p258) can coat up to 3 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 1 minute. Applying the poison takes 1 action. Any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This poison usually sells for 1200gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).","chat":"20","unidentified":"Nature"},"source":"Wyvern","quantity":1,"weight":7,"price":{"value":600,"denomination":"gp"},"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true},"folder":null,"ownership":{"default":0,"UDIYq77k2aTlndBT":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1687571137449,"modifiedTime":1687571137449,"lastModifiedBy":"UDIYq77k2aTlndBT"},"_id":"AoO78W7sVaJ8oR4s"}

Thri-kreen Poison (Injury): A creature can spend an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until it successfully affects a target. A creature hit with a weapon coated with this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This poison usually sells for 200gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).","chat":"15","unidentified":"Medicine"},"source":"Thri-Kreen","quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":{"value":10,"denomination":"gp"},"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true},"folder":null,"ownership":{"default":0,"UDIYq77k2aTlndBT":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1687571137063,"modifiedTime":1687571137063,"lastModifiedBy":"UDIYq77k2aTlndBT"},"_id":"cDAocGapad06RI13"}
