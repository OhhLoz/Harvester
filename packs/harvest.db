On a failed check, the character is unable to extract the poison gland. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the gland is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 1 hour and 50gp worth of material to create Ettercap Poison (DC 12 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Ettercap Poison (Injury): A creature can spend an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until it successfully affects a target. A creature hit with a weapon coated with this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This poison usually sells for 100gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Ettercap","quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":{"value":10,"denomination":"gp"},"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true},"folder":null,"ownership":{"default":0,"UDIYq77k2aTlndBT":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1687373728832,"modifiedTime":1687373728832,"lastModifiedBy":"UDIYq77k2aTlndBT"},"_id":"yGVeIRHqbQh7CXZr"}
