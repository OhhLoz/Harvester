Drider Poison (Injury): A creature can use an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute, or until a target is successfully affected by the poison. A creature successfully hit with Drider Poison must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw.
