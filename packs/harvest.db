Grung Poison (Contact): Grung poison is a contact poison, and has a similar (but lesser) effect as Drow Poison (DMG p258). A creature can spend an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until it successfully affects a target. A creature touched with this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute (a poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks). This poison usually sells for 150gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Grung","quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":{"value":2,"denomination":"gp"},"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true},"folder":null,"ownership":{"default":0,"UDIYq77k2aTlndBT":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1687366282637,"modifiedTime":1687366282637,"lastModifiedBy":"UDIYq77k2aTlndBT"},"_id":"JSalKVhuC6XtmENe"}
